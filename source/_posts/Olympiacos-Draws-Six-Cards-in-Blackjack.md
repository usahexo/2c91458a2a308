#  Olympiacos Draws Six Cards in Blackjack

In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Olympiacos drew six cards at blackjack in the Casino Lisboa in Macau. The players were given red cards on their first three rounds, and then green cards on their fourth and fifth rounds.

The casino announced that it would not be paying out any wins from the game, as the players were all using their own strategies to draw cards. This is not the first time Olympiacos has caused a stir at the casino; they previously won €500,000 from a blackjack game in February.

Olympiacos is currently in Macau as part of their preseason tour; they are scheduled to play two more games against Chinese clubs before returning to Greece.

#  Olympiacos Draws More Cards Than the Dealer in Blackjack

In a recent study of over 1,000 blackjack hands at the Casino of Olympia in Athens, Greece, it was found that Olympiacos averaged drawing more cards than the dealer. While it is not unusual for a player to draw more cards than the dealer – many times this results in a winning hand – in this case Olympiacos' extra cards led to an overall loss of 0.73%.

Interestingly, Olympiacos fared much better when playing against a dealer who stood on soft 17 (a hand made up of an ace and six), winning almost 54% of the time. When playing against dealers who hit on soft 17, however, Olympiacos lost nearly 60% of the time.

The study's author, Dr. Konstantinos Nikolaidis, believes that the team's propensity to draw more cards than the dealer is due, in part, to a lack of understanding of basic blackjack strategy. "Olympiacos would be well-advised to learn when to hit and when to stand," said Nikolaidis. "This would likely result in a more successful gambling experience."

# Blackjack - A Game of Skill or Chance?

There is ongoing debate as to whether blackjack is a game of skill or chance. Some people believe that success at blackjack hinges solely on luck, while others maintain that proper strategic play can give players an advantage.

The truth is that both skill and chance are involved in blackjack. It is possible for skilled players to win more money than unskilled players, but Lady Luck still has a significant role to play. Ultimately, whether or not you succeed at blackjack depends on how lucky you are and how well you play your cards.

#  Olympiacos Can't Seem to Stop Drawing Cards in Blackjack

The Olympiacos CFP football team has been on a bit of a bad luck streak as of late. The team can't seem to seem to stop drawing cards in blackjack, which has led to several consecutive draws and losses.

In their latest match against AEK Athens, Olympiacos was down 2-1 in the last minutes of the game. However, they were able to score two goals in quick succession to take the lead. Unfortunately for them, AEK Athens was able to score an equalizing goal in the last few seconds of the game, resulting in a 3-3 draw.

This is unfortunately not an isolated incident for Olympiacos CFP. In their previous match against PAOK Salonika, they were also down 2-1 in the last minutes of the game. However, they were only able to score one goal and ended up losing 3-2.

Some fans are beginning to question whether or not manager Oscar Garcia is doing a good job with the team. Some have gone so far as to call for his resignation. However, Garcia himself seems to be quite confident that things will turn around soon. He has stated that "Olympiacos are going through a tough patch at the moment but we're working hard and things will get better."

Only time will tell whether or not Garcia is right and Olympiacos will start winning again soon. In the meantime, they will need to start scoring more goals if they want to avoid another drawn out season.

#  Olympiacos Keeps Taking More Cards in Blackjack

Olympiacos Roulette and Blackjack clubs in Athens seem to have a problem with members continuously taking more cards than they should, putting the games at risk of violating provincial regulations.

The Olympiacos casino on Leoforos Alexandras Avenue, which has both Roulette and Blackjack tables, opened in late 2017. According to reports, it had only been open a few weeks when management realized that some of its members were playing recklessly and taking more cards than they should, potentially putting the games at risk of violating provincial regulations.

Under the regulations, casinos are allowed to have just four cards in their decks at any one time. If a player takes more than four cards, the casino is not allowed to continue dealing. In such a case, the offending player would be penalized and the game would be stopped.

In order to prevent this from happening, Olympiacos management decided to limit the number of cards that each player could take per game. This seems to have solved the problem for the time being, but it is something that will need to be monitored closely.

Olympiacos isn’t the only casino facing this issue. In January 2018, Thessaloniki’s Grand Casino was temporarily closed after it was discovered that one of its players had taken more than six cards in a Blackjack game, violating provincial regulations.

#  Olympiacos Gambling Problem? They're Drawing Lots of Cards in Blackjack

​There's something fishy going on with Olympiacos in blackjack. The Greek club has been playing a suspicious number of hands, and it looks like they might be up to something.

​Olympiacos has been playing almost twice as many hands as the next-closest team in the Serie A this season. They've also been drawing more cards than anyone else in the league. In fact, their draw rate is more than 50% higher than 7th place Milan.

​What's causing all these extra cards? Could Olympiacos be cheating?

There's no proof that Olympiacos is doing anything wrong, but their high number of draws is definitely raising some eyebrows. It's not clear what they could be doing to get so many extra cards, but it's definitely worth investigating.

​Hopefully, UEFA will take a closer look at Olympiacos' play and get to the bottom of this mystery. If they are cheating, they need to be punished!
