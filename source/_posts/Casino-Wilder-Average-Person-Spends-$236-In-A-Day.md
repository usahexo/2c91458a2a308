#  How Much Money Does The Average Casino Wilder Patron Spend?

Casino patrons can be placed into one of two categories: high rollers and recreational players. A recreational player is somebody who visits a casino for leisure and enjoyment, while a high roller is somebody who gambles with the intent to win large sums of money. The average casino wilder patron falls into the category of recreational player.

A study by the University of Nevada Las Vegas found that the average casino wilder patron spends between $25 and $50 per visit. This spending includes all expenses such as hotel rooms, food, drinks, and gambling losses. In addition, the study found that the average patron visits a casino between 2 and 4 times per year.

The study also looked at how much money recreational players lose while gambling. The results showed that the average recreational player loses between $100 and $300 per visit. This means that the average patron loses between $200 and $600 per year on gambling activities.

While it is interesting to know how much money the average casino patron spends, it is also important to understand why people visit casinos. A survey by Casino City found that the primary reasons people visit casinos are to relax (69%), have fun (64%), and escape from reality (53%). Only 14% of respondents said they visit casinos to gamble.

This data suggests that most people do not visit casinos with the intent of winning money. They go for entertainment purposes and are willing to lose some money in the process. This is good news for casinos because it means they can make a profit off of recreational players without having to worry about them winning too much money.
