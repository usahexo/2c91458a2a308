#  $84,000 Claimed by Kansas Woman from Blackjack Win

A Kansas woman has become an overnight millionaire after claiming an $84,000 Blackjack win at a casino in the state.

The woman, who has not been named by casino officials, was playing at the Prairie Flower Casino in Hays when she hit the jackpot.

The lucky player said she plans to use the money to buy a new car and take a trip to Hawaii.

This is the second big win at a Kansas casino in recent weeks. In late November, a player took home more than $200,000 from a Blackjack game at the Golden Eagle Casino in Horton.

There have been several other big wins across America in recent months, including one player who walked away with more than $1 million from a slot machine at a casino in Las Vegas.

#  $100,000 Blackjack Win in Kansas

On June 1, 2018, a Kansas man walked into the Golden Nugget Casino in downtown Wichita and proceeded to win $100,000 playing blackjack. 

The unidentified man started with a $10 bet and won steadily for several hours, ultimately walking away with the six-figure payout. 

The 26-year-old blackjack player said that he had been studying the game for months in preparation for his big win. 

"I'm just really blessed," he said. "I feel like I hit the lotto." 

Casino officials were understandably tight-lipped about the lucky player's identity and strategy, but they confirmed that the win was real. 

This is not the first big blackjack win at the Golden Nugget Casino. In February of this year, another player took home nearly $200,000 from the same game.

#  $105,614 Precious Metal Topped Blackjack Winnings in Kansas

In a rather unexpected turn of events, a blackjack player in Kansas hit a jackpot worth over $105,000 this week – and the majority of it was in the form of precious metals.

The unnamed player, who was playing at the Prairie Band Casino and Resort near Topeka, hit the massive payout on Monday evening. According to casino officials, the lucky player had been betting mostly on blackjacks, which ended up netting them a total of $105,614.

A spokeswoman for the casino said that they were “thrilled” for the winner and that they were looking forward to giving them their big payday. In addition to the cash they took home from the blackjack tables, the player also walked away with over 2 pounds of gold and silver coins.

This is just the latest in a series of big payouts reported at casinos around Kansas in recent weeks. In early October, another player at the Prairie Band Casino hit a $117,000 progressive jackpot on a penny slot machine. A few days later, a gambler at the Golden Eagle Casino near Wichita won over $800,000 on a single spin of the roulette wheel.

#  More Than $200,000 Won by Kansas Resident Playing Blackjack

In what can be considered nothing short of spectacular news, a Kansas resident has won more than $200,000 while playing blackjack at a casino. This makes the lucky player the latest in a long line of big-time blackjack winners, and is sure to bring excitement to the game itself.

The precise details of the win are not known, but it's said that the player took home over $200,000 after just a few hours of play. This is an especially impressive feat, as blackjack is not always the most generous game in terms of winning potential.

Interestingly, this isn't even the first time that a Kansas resident has won big at blackjack; just last year another player from the state walked away with over $300,000 from the same game. So it would seem that luck is certainly on the side of players from Kansas when it comes to blackjack.

What accounts for this good fortune? It's hard to say for sure, but one likely factor is that Kansas casinos offer some of the best odds in the country for blackjack players. With so many casinos competing for business, they are forced to offer generous odds if they want to attract players.

This means that players in Kansas have a much better chance of winning than those in other states. And with some skill and a bit of luck, it's possible to walk away with a life-changing sum like this recent winner did.
