#  New York State Officials Crack Down on Illegal Online Gambling

New York State officials are cracking down on illegal online gambling. The state has been targeting unlicensed online casinos and poker sites, and has issued dozens of cease-and-desist letters.

Illegal online gambling has been a growing problem in New York. In recent years, the number of unlicensed online casinos and poker sites has exploded. These sites are often operated by organized crime syndicates, and they offer games that are not sanctioned by the state government.

Officials have repeatedly warned residents about the dangers of illegal online gambling. They say that these sites are often scams, and that players can lose money quickly and easily. In addition, the state government does not regulate or oversee these sites, so there is no guarantee that players will be treated fairly.

Recently, the state government began to take action against these illegal sites. In February 2018, officials issued dozens of cease-and-desist letters to unlicensed online casinos and poker sites. The letters demanded that the sites stop operating in New York, or face legal action.

So far, the state government has had success in shutting down many of these unlicensed sites. However, there are still many others that remain open for business. Officials say that they will continue to crack down on these sites, and will take legal action against anyone who violates New York law.

#  Online Gambling Remains Unlawful in New York State

Despite the fact that online gambling is a multi-billion dollar industry, it remains unlawful in New York State. This is largely due to the efforts of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who has long argued that online gambling should be illegal because it is too easy for people to gamble and lose money.

However, some lawmakers in New York are now pushing for the legalization of online gambling, arguing that it could bring millions of dollars in tax revenue to the state. In addition, they argue that it would be a boon to the state's economy, creating jobs and generating income for businesses.

Currently, there are two bills pending in the New York State legislature that would legalize online gambling. The first, known as The Internet Poker and Casino Act, would create a regulatory framework for online poker and other casino games. The second bill, known as The Gaming NY Act, would allow for full-scale online gambling, including sports betting and casino games.

So far, neither of these bills has been successful in gaining traction in the state legislature. However, with the increasing popularity of online gambling, it is likely that we will see more movement on this issue in the coming years.

#  Unlicensed Online Gambling Operators Facing Charges in New York

The New York Attorney General’s office is cracking down on unlicensed online gambling operators with a new wave of prosecutions. AG Eric Schneiderman announced the action against three operators on Monday, stating that they were illegally accepting bets from consumers in the state.

“As we warned these companies, if you come to New York and try to run an illegal online gambling operation, you will face serious consequences,” said Schneiderman. “We have now put three operations out of business, and we will continue our vigilant prosecution of these crimes.”

The three defendants named in the case are listed as Christopher Costigan, Dennis Franco and Peter Grosskopf. Costigan allegedly operated an online poker website known as PokerStars, while Franco and Grosskopf were involved in casino-style games such as blackjack and roulette.

All three defendants are being charged with felony counts of promoting gambling and conspiracy. They could face up to four years in prison if convicted. In addition, Schneiderman is seeking $3 million in damages from each defendant.

This latest action by the New York Attorney General builds on an earlier crackdown on illegal gambling operations which began last year. In that case, twelve websites were shut down after being accused of taking bets from New Yorkers. It is estimated that between $2 billion and $3 billion is wagered illegally each year in the United States, with much of that activity taking place online.

Illegal online gambling has been around for many years, but it has become increasingly popular in recent years because of the growth of Internet access worldwide. Estimates vary as to how much money is gambled illegally online each year, but it is certainly a multi-billion dollar industry.

Most countries have laws against gambling online, but enforcement can be difficult given the global nature of the Internet. Many operators who offer illegal gambling services are located offshore in jurisdictions where it is not illegal to do so. This can make it difficult for law enforcement officials to take action against them.

In addition to the legal issues, there are also risks for consumers who engage in illegal gambling activities online. There is no guarantee that the websites they are using are legitimate or that the games they are playing are fair. There is also no protection against fraud or identity theft if personal information is provided to unlicensed operators.

#  Illegal Online Gambling Continues to Plague New York

In spite of increased regulation and law enforcement action, illegal online gambling continues to be a problem in New York. According to a recent report by the New York State Office of the Attorney General, unlicensed and unregulated websites accepting bets from New Yorkers generated over $1.5 billion in revenues in 2017.

This is not the first time that illegal online gambling has been identified as a problem in New York. A 2016 report by the same agency estimated that unlicensed gambling sites took in over $1.3 billion from New Yorkers during that year.

Online gambling is legal in only three states in the U.S.: Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey. All other forms of online gambling, including poker and casino games, are considered illegal under federal law. This makes it difficult for law enforcement officials to take action against these sites, as they are operating from outside of U.S. jurisdiction.

In addition to the difficulties posed by federal law, state regulation of online gambling is also complicated by the fact that different types of gambling are regulated by different agencies. The New York State Gaming Commission is responsible for regulating casino-style games such as blackjack and roulette, while the New York State Racing and Wagering Board oversees horseracing and dog racing. Poker falls into a grey area since it involves elements of both casino games and sports betting, which are regulated by different agencies.

Illegal online gambling has been linked to a number of negative consequences, including addiction, financial hardship, and criminal activity. In addition, these sites often do not follow responsible gaming practices, such as refusing to allow players to bet more than they can afford to lose or restricting access to minors.

The Attorney General's office is calling on the state legislature to pass comprehensive legislation regulating online gambling in order to protect consumers and crack down on illegal operators.

#  New York State Leads the Charge Against Illegal Online Gambling

New York State's Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, is taking the lead in the fight against illegal online gambling. Schneiderman has announced that his office will be working with state and federal law enforcement agencies to crack down on illegal online gambling operations.

Illegal online gambling is a big business, and it's been estimated that it generates more than $4 billion in revenue each year. Much of this activity is conducted on offshore websites, which are beyond the reach of U.S. law enforcement.

Schneiderman is determined to shut down these illegal operations and protect consumers from the risks associated with them. He noted that "online gambling is not a victimless crime," and that it can lead to financial ruin for those who get caught up in it.

Schneiderman isn't alone in his efforts to combat illegal online gambling. The Department of Justice has also made it a priority to shut down these operations, and they've been working with state and local law enforcement agencies to do just that.

So far, the efforts of New York State and the Department of Justice have been successful in shutting down several illegal online gambling operations. In addition, they've seized millions of dollars in assets that were associated with these operations.

It's likely that this effort will continue, as both New York State and the Department of Justice are committed to putting an end to illegal online gambling.
