PORT MACHINE, Fla. — A player at the Port Machine hit the slot machine five times in a row early Wednesday morning and walked away with $1 million.

"I just couldn't believe it," said the winner, who asked to remain anonymous. "It was like a dream."

The lucky player was betting just $2 per spin on the Wheel of Fortune progressive slot machine when the amazing run of good luck began.

"I was actually on my way out of the casino when I decided to give the machine one last spin," said the winner. "And then it happened — five times in a row!"

Port Machine officials say this is only the third time they've had a jackpot winner take home more than $1 million. The last such win happened in December 2016.

The Port Machine has been a popular slot game in casinos for years. A player hit the x5 symbol five times on the same spin, winning the progressive jackpot of $10 million.

"It's a feeling I can't describe," said the lucky winner, who wished to remain anonymous. "I just can't believe it."

The Port Machine is a traditional slot game with three spinning reels and 20 fixed paylines. The game has a maritime theme, with symbols including anchors, compasses, sextants, and ships. The x5 symbol is a wildcard and pays out the progressive jackpot when five are hit on an active payline.

Casino staff were shocked when the winner hit the jackpot on their spin. Slot machines are programmed to payout randomly, so there is no specific pattern that guarantees a win.

"We've never had anything like this happen before," said one employee. "It's just amazing."

The Port Machine is not the only slot game with a progressive jackpot. Other popular games include Mega Moolah, Arabian Nights, and Hall of Gods. All of these games offer jackpots that can reach into the millions of dollars.

So if you're feeling lucky, be sure to try your hand at one of these games! Who knows - you might be next to become a millionaire.
