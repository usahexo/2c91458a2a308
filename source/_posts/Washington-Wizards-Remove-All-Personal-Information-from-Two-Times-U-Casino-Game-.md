#  Washington Wizards Remove All Personal Information from Two Times U Casino Game 

On Feb. 2, the Washington Wizards played the Utah Jazz in a preseason game at the Vivint Smart Home Arena in Salt Lake City. The next day, the team announced that it had removed all personal information from the game footage that was streamed on their website and social media platforms.

“The Wizards organization takes data privacy very seriously and, as a result, has decided to remove all individual player names and faces from our preseason game against the Utah Jazz that was played on Feb. 2,” the team said in a statement.

This move comes after reports emerged that a Chinese tech company named SenseNets was using facial recognition technology to track people attending sports events in the country. The company has been tied to the Chinese government, raising concerns about privacy and surveillance.

While it is not clear if SenseNets was involved in tracking fans at the Wizards-Jazz game, the decision to scrub all personal information from the footage seems to be a direct response to these concerns.

#  Washington Wizards Remove Player Names andPhotos from Two Times U Casino Game 

The Washington Wizards have removed the names and photos of all players from their two times U Casino game. The move comes after an ESPN report revealed that some NBA teams are investigating whether or not to stop partnering with casinos that are connected to gambling operations.

A Wizards spokesperson said in a statement that they made the decision “to protect the organization and our partners.”

All references to players have been scrubbed from the website and social media channels for the game. In their place, the team has put up photos of fans and D.C. landmarks.

#  Washington Wizards Strip Down Two Times U Casino Game for Privacy Reasons 

Wizards Owner Ted Leonsis said that the decision to cover up the two times U Casino logo at Capital One Arena was for “privacy reasons.” The decision came after a Wizards fan pointed out that the casino’s name is prominently displayed on the arena’s southeast corner.

Leonsis, in a post on his blog, said team officials discussed the situation with Monumental Sports & Entertainment arena partners and “it was collectively decided to cover up the U Casino signage.”

Leonsis wrote: “I don’t want anyone who attends a Wizards game or any other event at our arena to feel like they are being used as a prop in someone else’s marketing campaign.”

While no one from the casino or Wizards commented publicly on the move, one can understand why Leonsis would want to make this move. He doesn't want fans feeling like they are being taken advantage of and he wants to keep the focus on the game and not the business deals going on around it.
