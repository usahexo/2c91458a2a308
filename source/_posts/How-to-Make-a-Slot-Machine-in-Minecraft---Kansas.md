#  How to Make a Slot Machine in Minecraft - Kansas

The first thing you're going to need is obsidian.

You can create obsidian by striking water with flint and steel.

Next, you'll need to build a frame out of obsidian. The frame should be 8 blocks wide and 5 blocks high.

In the center of the frame, place a dispenser facing downwards.

Next, place an Iron block on top of the dispenser. Finally, place 3 levers on the sides of the frame.

Now it's time to add the prizes!

For each slot, you'll need: 1 emerald, 2 gold ingots, and 3 diamonds.

Prizes can be placed in any order in the slot machine, but each slot must have at least one of each type of prize.

To make it more fun, you can add some extra features:

-Add chests to store the player's loot between spins.
-Add Redstone torches to light up the machine when it's active.

#  Minecraft: How to Make a Slot Machine Tutorial - Kansas

In this Minecraft tutorial, you will learn how to make a slot machine. This is a fairly simple project, but it can be a lot of fun to play with and watch your friends gamble their hard-earned resources on it!

To make a slot machine in Minecraft, you will need the following supplies:

-Three blocks of obsidian
-One block of redstone
-Five buttons
-One lever
-One block of TNT

Start by constructing a small three by three square out of obsidian blocks. You will also need to create a small hollow space in the center of this square. This will be your slot machine's "payout area."

Next, place a block of redstone in the middle of the square. Then, place four buttons on each side of the redstone block. Finally, place a lever on one side of the square.

Now, it's time to add the "mechanism" that will power your slot machine. In the center of the square, place a block of TNT. Be very careful not to detonate it prematurely!

Connect the lever to the TNT block with some redstone wire. Now, when you pull the lever down, it will activate the TNT and cause it to explode. This will rotate the obsidian blocks around and players will be able to play your slot machine!

The first thing you'll need to do is gather up 63 iron ingots. Once you have them, set them up in an "X" shape as shown in the diagram below.


Next, we'll need to craft a couple of levers. To do so, place 2 cobblestone blocks in the crafting grid, and then put a stick in the top-left corner. You should now have 2 levers.


Now that we have all of our materials, it's time to start building! First, place the iron ingots into the slots as shown in the diagram below. Note that the bottom-left and top-left slots should be empty.


Next, place the levers on either side of the machine as shown in the diagram below.


Finally, it's time to test it out! To do so, right-click one of the levers and then quickly right-click the other lever. If everything is working correctly, you should see 3 symbols pop up on the screen as shown below.
