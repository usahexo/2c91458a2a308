#  When To Split Pairs In Blackjack: Wilder's Strategy Explained 

In blackjack, the splitting of pairs is one of the more important decisions a player can make. It can be the difference between winning and losing and, if done correctly, can increase your chances of winning. There are many different methods for splitting pairs, but one of the most popular is Wilder’s strategy.

Wilder’s strategy was developed by Arnold Wilder, a professional blackjack player and author of “The Blackjack Formula”. The strategy is simple to learn and easy to use, and can be applied in any situation where you are offered the chance to split your cards.

To use Wilder’s strategy, you first need to know what constitutes a pair. In blackjack, a pair is two cards of the same rank. For example, two eights, two sixes or two kings. Aces can be counted as either one or eleven, so they are not considered to be part of a pair.

Once you have ascertained that you have a pair, you need to decide whether or not to split them. To do this, you need to consider a number of factors including the dealer’s up card (the first card that is face up), your total points and the number of decks being used.

If you have a pair and the dealer has an up card of 2 through 6, then you should always split your cards. This gives you the best chance of winning since the dealer has a high probability of busting (going over 21).

If you have a pair and the dealer has an up card of 7 or 8, then it is advisable to split your cards unless you have 17 or more points total. This is because the dealer has a good chance of getting closer to 21 than you do with just one card.

If you have a pair and the dealer has an up card of 9, 10 or Ace, then it is usually better to keep your cards together rather than splitting them. This is because there is still a good chance that the dealer will bust while you could improve your hand by splitting them.

#  When to Split Pairs in Blackjack - The Wilder Way 

In blackjack, as in any other casino game, the aim is to beat the dealer. There are a number of different strategies that can be used to achieve this, and one of the most important factors to consider is when to split pairs.

There are various schools of thought on this subject, with some players advocating splitting every time, others only splitting if they have certain cards, and still others only splitting when they have a high card. However, there is a strategy that stands out from the rest, and that is the Wilder way.

The Wilder way is based on the fact that the player should split any pair that totals 9 or greater. So, for example, if you are dealt two 8s you would split them, as they total 16. And if you were dealt two Aces you would also split them, as they total 12 (and 2 is a good number to have against a dealer's up card).

The logic behind this strategy is that it gives the player more chances to win by giving them two hands rather than one. Furthermore, it increases their odds of getting a 10 (which pays out at 3:2), as there are more 10s in the deck when there are more cards totalling 9 or more.

While this strategy may seem risky at first, it is actually very effective and can increase your chances of winning significantly. So why not give it a try next time you're playing blackjack?

#  Blackjack Strategy: When to Split Pairs According to Wilder 

In blackjack, when to split pairs is one of the more important decisions a player has to make. This is because splitting pairs can result in two potentially winning hands, or it can lead to disaster if the players splits a ten-valued card and ends up with two hands totaling 20.

To help players make the best decision when to split pairs, blackjack expert Gene Wilder came up with a list of guidelines for when to do so. The list is as follows: 

1. Always split aces and 8s.
2. Split 2s, 3s, 4s, and 5s if the dealer shows a 2, 3, 4, or 5 upcard.
3. Split 6s and 7s only if the dealer shows a three or higher upcard.
4. Do not split 10s, queens, kings, or aces.
5. If you have four cards to a straight flush (excluding 10-J-Q-K), split them (except 10-J-Q-K).
6. If you have four cards to two different flushes (excluding 10-J-Q-K), split them (except 10-J-Q-K).

There are several reasons why Wilder's guidelines should be followed when playing blackjack. The first reason is that following the guidelines will give players the best chance to win at the game. For example, by splitting 8s instead of hitting them as one hand, players are increasing their chances of winning two hands rather than just one hand with a higher total value. 

Secondly, following these guidelines will protect players against disaster in case they happen to bust on their initial hand. For instance, splitting 6s and 7s instead of hitting when the dealer shows a three or higher upcard gives players a better chance of not busting on both hands while still having a playable hand remaining. 

Thirdly, by splitting pairs according to Wilder's guidelines instead of blindly following casino rules or hunches, players can actually increase their chances of winning money in the long run by making better strategic decisions at the table.

#  Master the Art of Splitting Pairs with Charles Wilder's Strategies 

In poker, splitting pairs can be a great way to get more value from your hand. But which split pairs strategy should you use?

Many experts recommend the “3 and 2” approach, splitting your pairs into three and two bets. This way, you can give yourself the best chance of winning both hands without risking too much money.

But what if the other player only wants to play one hand? In this case, you might want to consider the “6 and 1” approach. Split your pairs into six and one bet, giving yourself a better chance of winning one hand while still protecting your investment.

No matter which split pairs strategy you choose, it’s important to remember that patience is key. Don’t be afraid to wait for the right opportunity before betting – it could make all the difference in the world.

#  How to Always Win at Blackjack: Follow Charles Wilder's Tips for Splitting Pairs

In any casino game, the house edge is always there, waiting to take your money. However, with a bit of strategy and some knowledge of the game you're playing, you can minimize the house edge and put yourself in a better position to walk away a winner.

Blackjack is one of the easiest casino games to play, but it can also be one of the most difficult games to win consistently. This is because blackjack relies heavily on player skill and decision-making, as opposed to luck alone.

One way to tilt the odds in your favor when playing blackjack is to follow the advice of professional blackjack player Charles Wilder. In particular, Wilder recommends splitting pairs whenever possible in order to increase your chances of winning.

When you split a pair in blackjack, you are actually doubling your bet and splitting your hand into two separate hands. This means that you now have two chances at winning instead of just one.

The key to splitting pairs successfully is to ensure that you have a good chance of winning both hands. For example, it's not usually wise to split pairs of low cards (2s through 6s). However, if you have two high cards (such as Aces or Kings), then splitting them is a smart move.

Another thing to keep in mind when splitting pairs is that you should always take only one card for each hand. This ensures that you remain in control of the game and don't give the house an advantage by surrendering too much information.

If you're able to implement these tips when playing blackjack, you'll find that your odds of winning will improve significantly. So next time you hit the casino floor, remember Charles Wilder's advice and put it into practice!
