#  How to Setup a Sports Betting Business at Home Aston Villa FC

This guide is for the Location Independent individual who wants to setup a sports betting business from home Aston Villa FC.

I will outline the basics that you need to get started and offer some advice on how to grow your new venture.

First things first, you will need to find a reputable sports betting software provider. There are many out there to choose from, but I suggest doing your research before signing up with any one provider.

Once you have found a suitable provider, you will then need to set-up an account and fund it with some starting capital. This money will be used to bet on various sporting events around the world.

Assuming you already have a laptop or computer with internet access, you are good to go! You can now start placing bets on the team or sport of your choice.

But how do you make money from this venture?

There are two ways in which you can make a profit from sports betting: by betting on the outcome of sporting events (known as ‘match betting’) or by trading odds in the run up to an event (known as ‘arbitrage’).

Match betting is where you bet on which team or athlete will win a particular event. For example, if you think Manchester United will beat Liverpool in their upcoming Premier League clash, then you would place a bet on Manchester United to win. If they do in fact win, then you will receive a payout from your bookmaker equal to your original stake multiplied by the odds offered for that particular bet.

Arbitrage is where you take advantage of different odds being offered by different bookmakers for the same event. This can be done by laying off part of your bet with another bookmaker at a more favourable price. For example, if Liverpool are 2/1 with one bookmaker to beat Everton but are available at 5/4 with another bookmaker, then arbitrage would suggest placing a £10 bet on Liverpool with the first bookmaker and £5 with the second bookmaker. If Liverpool win, then the first bookmaker pays out £30 (your original stake multiplied by 2/1) and the second bookmaker pays out £20 (your original stake multiplied by 5/4), giving you a total profit of £10.
