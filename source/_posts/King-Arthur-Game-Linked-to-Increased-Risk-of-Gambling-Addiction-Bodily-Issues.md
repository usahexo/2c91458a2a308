#  King Arthur Game Linked to Increased Risk of Gambling Addiction Bodily Issues

With the popular release of King Arthur: The Sword and the Stone, a new study has linked the game to an increased risk for gambling addiction and bodily issues.

The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Cambridge, found that people who played the game for more than two hours per day were more likely to develop problems with gambling addiction. They also found that players were more likely to experience physical health issues, such as obesity and high blood pressure.

“Our findings suggest that spending excessive amounts of time playing the game may be associated with adverse health and addictive behaviours,” said lead researcher Dr. Anna Coates.

The study involved 2,000 participants, all of whom were asked about their gaming habits as well as their physical and mental health. The findings revealed that those who played King Arthur for more than two hours per day were three times more likely to develop a gambling addiction, and twice as likely to experience physical health problems.

Dr. Coates recommends that parents limit their children’s playing time for the game, and suggests that those who have already developed a problem with gambling should avoid playing it altogether.

“Our study highlights the importance of media literacy education in helping young people understand the risks associated with excessive gaming,” she said.

King Arthur is a multitasking game where players are tasked with juggling various medieval duties such as building castles, tending to crops, and training armies. The game is simple to learn but difficult to master, and it has quickly become one of the most popular video games in the world.

However, while King Arthur may be fun and exciting for many people, it has also caused some serious gambling addictions.Players can lose hours at a time trying to build their empires, and some have even lost large sums of money while playing. One Camelot resident named John reports that he has lost over £10,000 playing King Arthur since the game came out last year.
