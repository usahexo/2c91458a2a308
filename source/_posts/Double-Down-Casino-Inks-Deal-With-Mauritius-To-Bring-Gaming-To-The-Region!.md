#  Double Down Casino Inks Deal With Mauritius To Bring Gaming To The Region!

Earlier in the week, Double Down Casino announced they had signed a deal with the government of Mauritius to bring their games and services to the region. The agreement will allow players on the island to access some of the most popular casino games in the world, as well as giving Double Down a foothold in one of the most rapidly growing gambling markets in the world.

Mauritius is an island country located in the Indian Ocean, about 2,000 kilometers east of Madagascar. The country has a population of just over 1.3 million people, and has been enjoying strong economic growth in recent years. The gaming industry is a key part of this growth, and Mauritius is seen as a major potential market for operators like Double Down.

Commenting on the deal,Double Down CEO James Stern said: "We are very excited to be working with the government of Mauritius to bring our world-class casino games to players on the island. Mauritius is a key growth market for us, and we believe that our games will be enjoyed by players here."

The agreement between Double Down and Mauritius covers both land-based and online gaming. Under the terms of the deal, Double Down will be able to set up operations on the island and offer their games through local partners. In addition, Double Down will work with the government to develop an online gaming framework that will allow locals to gamble online using Mauritian currency.

Double Down's entry into Mauritius follows hot on the heels of similar deals signed by other leading casino operators. Last year, Wynn Resorts struck a deal withthe government of Cotai to bring their Wynn Macau resortto the island. And in March this year, MGM Resorts announced they would be buildinga $1 billion resortin Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam.

#  Mauritius Gets A New Casino, And It's Double Down!

Mauritius is a country in the southernmost tip of Africa, and it's been enjoying a bit of a gambling boon lately. The government has just okayed the construction of a new casino, which is set to open in 2019.

The new casino, called "Double Down", will be built by the Malaysian company Genting. It's set to have all the bells and whistles: restaurants, bars, a hotel, and of course, hundreds of slot machines and gaming tables.

The hope is that the new casino will help to bolster tourism in Mauritius. The country has long been known for its beautiful beaches and luxury resorts, but its casinos haven't had the same appeal. With Double Down, that could all change.

Construction on the new casino is set to begin in early 2018, and it's expected to create 1,000 jobs. That's great news for Mauritius, which is still recovering from the effects of the global recession.

#  Double Down Goes International With Mauritius Deal!

Online gambling operator Double Down Interactive LLC has announced a new partnership with the Mauritius-based gambling company Digicel Play. The new agreement will see Double Down launch its popular social casino games in French and English in over 100 countries worldwide.

The new partnership is a big step forward for Double Down, which saw revenues of $211 million in 2016. The company is looking to expand its user base outside of the United States, where online gambling is currently illegal.

"We are very excited to work with Digicel Play and bring our popular casino games to players all over the world," said Greg Enell, CEO of Double Down. "This partnership represents an important step in our international growth strategy and we look forward to working with Digicel Play to make our games available to even more players."

Digicel Play is a subsidiary of the telecommunications giant Digicel, which operates in 33 countries throughout the Caribbean, Central America, and Asia Pacific. The company started operations in 2013 and now has over two million active users.

Under the terms of the agreement, Digicel Play will market and distribute Double Down's games through its network of retail stores, website, and mobile app. In addition, the two companies will work together to develop new games specifically for the international market.

"Double Down Interactive LLC is one of the leading social casino providers in the world so we are really pleased to be partnering with them," said Pavandeep Singh Kalsi, CEO of Digicel Play. "This partnership will not only bring some amazing new casino games to our customers but it will also help us further strengthen our position as one of the leading providers of online gaming content globally."

#  Casino Chains Look To Expand Into Mauritius!

Casino chains are looking to expand into the island nation of Mauritius, as the country looks to legalize gambling. The casino industry is currently worth an estimated $38.9 billion, and it is expected to grow by 4.1% annually through 2020. This presents a huge opportunity for casino chains, which are looking to expand into new markets in order to boost revenue.

Mauritius has been considering legalizing gambling for some time now, and it seems that the process is moving ahead. The government has formed a committee to study the issue and has commissioned a study on the potential economic impact of gambling. The study is expected to be completed by the end of 2017, and if it shows that gambling can be beneficial to the country, then legalization could move ahead quickly.

If Mauritius does legalize gambling, it could be a big boon for the casino industry. The country has a population of 1.3 million people, and it is located close to some major gaming markets like India and China. This could attract casino operators looking to expand into new markets.

Casino chains are already expanding into other countries in Africa, and Mauritius could be the next target. Casino operators like MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts Ltd have already expressed interest in expanding into the country, and they are likely not the only ones. There is sure to be intense competition among casino operators to win one of the coveted licenses in Mauritius.

The legalization of gambling in Mauritius would represent a major shift in policy, but there is good reason to believe that it could be successful. The country has a strong economy and there is already a large underground gambling market there. If the government can manage to regulate and tax gambling properly, then it could provide a significant boost to the economy.

Gambling has proven to be a lucrative industry for many countries, and Mauritius appears ready to join their ranks. Casino chains are likely going to battle for licenses in Mauritius, so there should be some exciting developments in the coming months!

#  Double Down Casino Ready To Enter African Market With Mauritius!

Mobile gaming giant, Double Down casino is all set to enter African market with its new launch in Mauritius. The company has already started its operations in the island nation and is offering its players some exclusive bonuses and rewards.

Mauritius is seen as an important market for Double Down casino because of its geographical location and the potential it offers for online gaming. The company is expecting good response from the players in Mauritius and is hoping to replicate the success it has achieved in other markets.

Some experts are of the opinion that Double Down casinoâ€™s entry into African market will heat up the competition among gaming companies operating in the region. This is likely to benefit players as they can look forward to better offers and more exciting games.
