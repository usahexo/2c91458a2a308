The right to operate a casino is guaranteed by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) of 1988. IGRA requires states to negotiate tribal-state compacts to regulate Class III gaming on Indian lands.</p>
<p>The purpose of the compacts is to give states a role in regulating and monitoring casino operations, while ensuring that the tribes retain exclusive authority over their casinos. The compacts also establish sharing arrangements between the tribes and the states for the revenues generated by the casinos.</p>
<p>There are two types of compacts: those that are negotiated individually between a tribe and a state, and those that are negotiated by the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) on behalf of multiple tribes and states. As of November 2017, NIGC had successfully negotiated more than 400 tribal-state compacts.</p>
<p>The process of negotiating a tribal-state compact can be difficult and time-consuming. In some cases, it has taken years for a compact to be negotiated and approved. This is due in part to the complexity of the issues involved and the competing interests of the parties involved.</p>
<p>Some key issues that need to be resolved in a tribal-state compact include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The nature of the gaming activities allowed at the casino</li>
<li>The jurisdiction of the casino, including which state and local laws apply</li>
<li>The regulatory authority of the state over casino operations</li>
<li>Revenue sharing arrangements between the tribe and state</li>
<li>Dispute resolution procedures</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Do-Nm-Tribes-Get-Enough-From-Gambling-Avg-Casino"><a href="#Do-Nm-Tribes-Get-Enough-From-Gambling-Avg-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Do Nm Tribes Get Enough From Gambling Avg. Casino?"></a>Do Nm Tribes Get Enough From Gambling Avg. Casino?</h1><p>There is a big discussion on whether or not Native American tribes get enough from gambling at casinos. The biggest concern comes from the amount of money that leaves the reservations and goes to the casino operators. This has led to some tribes considering setting up their own casinos.</p>
<p>In 2017, the National Indian Gaming Association (NIGA) estimated that tribal gaming brought in over $32 billion to tribal and local governments. Out of that total, over $27 billion went back to the tribes. This is a significant amount of money, but it’s important to look at where it goes and how it is used.</p>
<p>Only about 2% of casino revenue goes to tribal members in direct payments. The rest goes back into the casinos for prizes, jackpots, marketing, and other expenses. This means that most tribal members don’t see much benefit from gambling at casinos. In some cases, they may even lose money because of increased crime and addiction rates.</p>
<p>Some tribes are looking for other ways to make money. This includes establishing their own casinos instead of relying on outside operators. It’s still unclear if this will be more beneficial for the tribes, but it’s something that will continue to be discussed.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Avg-Casino-Necessity-For-Nm-Tribes"><a href="#Gambling-Avg-Casino-Necessity-For-Nm-Tribes" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Avg Casino: Necessity For Nm Tribes ?"></a>Gambling Avg Casino: Necessity For Nm Tribes ?</h1><p>On July 1, 2019, the New Mexico Gaming Control Board (NMGCB) levied a $20,000 civil penalty against the Acoma Pueblo for two Class II gaming violations. The first violation was for using an electronic gaming device in connection with gambling and the second was for permitting a person who is not a member of the tribe to gamble on the pueblo’s premises.</p>
<p>Both of these violations are in direct violation of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) which requires that tribes only offer games that are specifically authorized by the act. This would include games such as bingo, pull tabs, and card games such as blackjack and poker. Slot machines are not authorized under IGRA and are therefore not permitted on tribal lands.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the Acoma Pueblo has been in violation of IGRA. In fact, they have been fined on numerous occasions for violating various provisions of the act. In November 2017, they were fined $10,000 for using an electronic gaming device and in April 2018 they were fined $5,000 for permitting someone who was not a tribal member to gamble on their premises.</p>
<p>While there may be some disagreement over the specific provisions of IGRA that have been violated by the Acoma Pueblo, it is clear that they are not in compliance with at least some of the requirements of the act. This begs the question: why isn’t compliance with IGRA more strictly enforced?</p>
<p>One possible reason is that many tribes see gambling as a necessary source of income. Gambling revenue accounts for a significant portion of tribal revenue nationwide and tribes have become increasingly dependent on it over time. This has led to a situation where many tribes feel that they cannot afford to lose their gambling revenue and are thus reluctant to comply with all of the provisions of IGRA.</p>
<p>Another possible reason is that there is a lack of clarity surrounding certain provisions of IGRA. This has led to confusion among both tribes and regulators as to what is and is not allowed under the act. Some regulators may be hesitant to levy heavy fines against tribes when there is uncertainty about how those fines will be interpreted or enforced.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason may be, it is clear that there is a lack of compliance with IGRA among many tribes nationwide. This raises concerns about both the accuracy of reporting by casinos and also about potential corruption among casino employees. It also calls into question whether or not gambling should be considered a necessary source of income for Native American tribes.</p>

The act consists of five main points:</p>
<p>1.<br>2.<br>3.<br>4.<br>5.<br>Since its enactment, IGRA has been amended numerous times and has resulted in a complex web of regulations which are difficult to interpret and apply. This has led to significant variability in the level of control states have over Indian gaming and, consequently, tribal sovereignty. In this article, we will explore the various ways states can exercise control over Indian gaming and the implications this has for tribal sovereignty.<br>First, we will provide a brief overview of IGRA and its key provisions. Next, we will examine three ways states can exercise control over Indian gaming: regulation of Class III gaming, prohibition of off-reservation gaming, and parens patriae authority. Finally, we will discuss the implications of state control for tribal sovereignty and suggest possible solutions to strengthen tribal sovereignty within the context of Indian gaming.</p>
<p>What is the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act?<br>The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) is a federal law that was enacted in 1988 in an attempt to regulate the emerging Indian gaming industry. The act consists of five main points: 1) tribes have the right to conduct Class III gaming on their lands; 2) states have the right to regulate or prohibit such gaming; 3) states have authority to license and regulate activities conducted by tribes pursuant to IGRA; 4) disputes regarding implementation or interpretation of IGRA are resolved by arbitration; and 5) violators are subject to civil penalties and criminal prosecution.[i]</p>
<p>Since its enactment, IGRA has been amended numerous times and has resulted in a complex web of regulations which are difficult to interpret and apply. This has led to significant variability in the level of control states have over Indian gaming and, consequently, tribal sovereignty. Let’s take a closer look at how states can exercise control over Indian gaming.<br>2 Most Common Ways States Exert Control Over Indian Gaming: Regulation Of Class III Gaming And Prohibition Of Off-Reservation Gaming<br>There are two primary ways states can exercise control over Indian gaming: regulating Class III gaming activities and prohibiting off-reservation gaming activities. We’ll explore each of these in more detail below.<br>2a Regulating Class III Gaming Activities<br>Class III gaming includes all forms of gambling that are not specifically authorized by state law.[ii] Thus, tribes conducting Class III gambling must first receive approval from the state in which they are located.[iii] In order for a tribe to obtain approval from a state government, it must typically enter into a compact with that state.[iv] As part of a compact agreement, the tribe typically agrees to certain terms and conditions which the state may impose.[v] These terms and conditions vary from state to state, but may include restrictions on game types, betting limits, hours of operation, and taxes.[vi] Compact negotiations can be lengthy and complex,[vii] often requiring input from both the tribe and state officials.[viii] Once a compact is approved by both parties, it is typically submitted to Congress for review.[ix] If Congress does not take any action within 60 days,[x] it is automatically ratified.[xi] Given the complexity of IGRA and the number of compacts being negotiated between tribes and states at any given time,[xii] it is inevitable that there will be inconsistencies between compact agreements across different states. This can create tension between tribes who feel that their rights are being violated by overly restrictive state regulations[xiii] and states who argue that they are simply exercising their authority under IGRA.[xiv]</p>
<p>2b Prohibiting Off-Reservation Gaming Activities<br>Another way states can exert control over Indian gambling is by prohibiting off-reservation gambling activities altogether.[xv] This essentially gives states veto power over any Tribal-State agreements involving off-reservation casinos.[xvi] As with regulating Class III gambling activities, this prohibition typically takes the form of a compact agreement between tribes and states.[xvii] Again, differences in state laws result in inconsistency between agreements across different jurisdictions. The practical effect of this inconsistency is that it becomes increasingly difficult for tribes wishing to conduct off-reservation casinos to gain approval from multiple jurisdictions.[xviii] This creates tension between tribes seeking economic development opportunities[xix] and those who argue that off-reservation casinos pose too great a threat to public safety[xx].</p>
<p>3 Parens Patriae Authority<br>In addition to regulating Class III gambling activities or prohibiting off-reservation gambling activities, states also have parens patriae authority under IGRA.[xxi] This Latin phrase translates literally as “parental love,” but is more commonly understood as meaning “of all persons interest.” In layman’s terms, parens patri</p>
<h1 id="Tribes-Push-For-Greater-Control-Over-Gambling-Avg-Casino"><a href="#Tribes-Push-For-Greater-Control-Over-Gambling-Avg-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Tribes Push For Greater Control Over Gambling Avg Casino"></a>Tribes Push For Greater Control Over Gambling Avg Casino</h1><p>With the advent of legalized gambling in many states, tribal leaders are voicing their desire for more autonomy over their casinos. In particular, they would like to be able to negotiate directly with the casinos’ operators, rather than going through the state government.</p>
<p>“As sovereign nations, we should be able to deal directly with the casino companies,” said one tribal leader. “We know our people best, and we should be the ones who decide how our casino is run.”</p>
<p>Not everyone agrees with this sentiment, of course. Some state officials argue that the tribes should continue to work through the state government in order to ensure fairness and consistency across all casinos in the state.</p>
<p> either way, it looks like this issue is only going to become more contentious in the years ahead.</p>
