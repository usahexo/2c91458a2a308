Anticipation has been high since the Rhode Island casino announced their plans for an online poker product, and on Monday the company released more details about their forthcoming site.</p>
<p>According to Twin River, the new site will launch in early 2019 and will offer both cash games and tournaments. Players will be able to access the room via their computers or mobile devices, making it possible to play while on the go.</p>
<p>In addition to Texas Hold’em and Omaha, players will also be able to enjoy some of the other popular poker variants such as 7-Card Stud and Razz. There will also be a variety of stakes available, ranging from micro-stakes all the way up to high-stakes games.</p>
<p>The new site is being built in partnership with The Stars Group, which already operates several successful online poker rooms including PokerStars, Full Tilt, and BetStars. That means that players can expect a high quality gaming experience, with plenty of features and gameplay options.</p>
<p>One thing that sets Twin River apart from some of the other big names in online poker is that their site will be open to players from all over the world. That means that anyone with an internet connection can log in and start playing.</p>
<p>Twin River has been gearing up for their online launch for some time now, signing deals with several gaming companies and building a team of experienced professionals. With just a few months left until launch, they are sure to be putting the finishing touches on everything and getting ready for an exciting debut.</p>
<h1 id="First-players-registered-for-Twin-River’s-new-online-poker-room"><a href="#First-players-registered-for-Twin-River’s-new-online-poker-room" class="headerlink" title="First players registered for Twin River’s new online poker room"></a>First players registered for Twin River’s new online poker room</h1><p>On March 1, 2019, the first players registered for Twin River’s new online poker room. This came as a surprise to many given that the new room had not yet been announced to the public. The new online poker room is expected to launch in the coming weeks, and it will be available to players in Rhode Island and Connecticut.</p>
<p>The new online poker room is part of Twin River’s effort to expand its business. The company has been struggling in recent years due to increased competition from casinos in nearby states. In order to stay afloat, Twin River has been investing in its online gaming platform. This includes a new online poker room, as well as a new online casino that is expected to launch soon.</p>
<p>The new online poker room at Twin River will offer a number of different tournaments and cash games. There will be a mix of no-limit and limit games, as well as tournaments that range from micro-stakes to high roller events. Players can also expect some of the softest competition in New England thanks to the large number of recreational players at Twin River.</p>
<p>The new online poker room is expected to launch in the coming weeks. In the meantime, you can learn more about Twin River by visiting their website at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.twinriver.com/">www.twinriver.com</a></p>
<h1 id="Twin-River-postpones-online-poker-room-launch"><a href="#Twin-River-postpones-online-poker-room-launch" class="headerlink" title="Twin River postpones online poker room launch"></a>Twin River postpones online poker room launch</h1><p>On Wednesday, Twin River Casino announced that they are postponing the launch of their new online poker room. This news comes as a bit of a surprise, as the company had announced in November that they were preparing to offer online casino and poker games in early 2019.</p>
<p>The decision to postpone the launch was reportedly made after consultation with the Rhode Island Division of Lottery. Officials cited the need for more time to complete extensive testing and security protocols as the reason for the delay.</p>
<p>No new launch date has been announced, but Twin River did say that they remain committed to offering online gaming products in Rhode Island. Players in the state will still be able to access real-money gaming through offshore operators until Twin River’s product goes live.</p>
<p>This announcement is just the latest setback for Twin River, which has been struggling financially in recent years. The company’s revenues have declined in each of the past three years, and net income fell by more than 60% between 2016 and 2017. In October, Twin River announced that it would be laying off nearly 200 employees, or about 15% of its workforce.</p>
<p>Despite these setbacks, it appears that Twin River is still intent on expanding into the online gaming market. This delay may give them more time to get things right, but it’s also possible that this move could cost them a significant share of the Rhode Island online poker market.</p>
